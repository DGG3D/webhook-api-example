# Webhook API
This is a simple webhook api example to test signature validation for implementing webhook endpoints on your server.

## Dependencies
This package requires node version >=16.

Install all npm dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn`.

## Running the webhook api
Run the webhook api with `npm run start` or `yarn start`. If you are running this on your local machine you might need something like ngrok to make your endpoint available to RapidCompact. If you are running this on your server you can just create a webhook on RapidCompact with its IP or domain name.
